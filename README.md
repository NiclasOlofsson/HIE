HIE
=======

The Healthcare Integration Engine (HIE) is a yet another integration engine with special focus on healthcare connectivity. It attempts to merge good architectural concepts from both *Mirth Connect* as well as *Microsoft BizTalk* to provide a next generation integration engine and integration IDE.

Technology aside, the most important aspect of the HIE project is really to provide a user friendly IDE that can both work for seasoned developers as well as people ignorant to coding.
